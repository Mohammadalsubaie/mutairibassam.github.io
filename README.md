## Welcome, to Datum!

> **_Employers want experienced developers, developers want to work to have experience._**

The main aim of Datum is filling the gap between the universities and the market demands.

`Datum` is a start-up that focuses on coaching rather than teaching. Why! teaching is the first step to learn anything new, but coaching is the way to master it.

There are a lot of books, tutorials, courses, bootcamps, and articles which help you to learn anything but there is no one will take by your hand to the next level. Everything depends on you alone.

#### How do we run our programs?
Our way for coaching is to let you live the real life of executing new projects. So, in our programs you have to deal with the following:
- Project chaos.
- Understand real user requirements.
- Deal with unrealistic deadlines.
- Work with a real team with a real leader.

Totally agree, It might sounds crazy! but you are not alone. We are applying different methods for simplifying these things.
